#Water Flow Concurrent Simulation
Java was used to simulate the flow of water across a terrain with varying levels of elevations.
The terrain data is taken in as a text file with height values, and a buffered Image class is used to translate that to an image.
The forkjoin framework was utilised to ensure liveliness and responsiveness of the simulated water movement. Java swing was
used to implement a graphical user interface.
